# K-Means
This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means Clustering using Python on a simple dataset. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups based on their features.

### Requirements
1. Python 3.8+
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. scikit-learn

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 10 manually created points in a 2D space.
The points form two distinct clusters.
### K-Means Clustering
The algorithm is applied to the dataset to divide the points into 2 clusters (n_clusters=2).
The algorithm iteratively adjusts the cluster centers and reassigns points to minimize intra-cluster variance.
